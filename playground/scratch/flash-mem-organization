Basic structure of flash memory
BYte - smallest adressable unit
page - 256 bytes basic write unit
sector - 4KB (16 pages x 246 bytes)  basic erase unit
block - 64KB (16 sectors) larger erase unit
chip - whole capacity  can be erased fully

THerefore each page is 256 bytes

Addressing
The flash memory is byte addressable
Code will express the address in terms of a page and an offset within that page

absolute_address = (page_number * page_size) + byte_offset

To avoid wrapping over on the same page
